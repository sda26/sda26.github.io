I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. I am carrying out my PhD work under the supervision of Dr. Luisa Hiller, whose [lab](https://www.bio.cmu.edu/labs/hiller/index.html) focusses on studying the various biological facets of the opportunistic pathogen, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.

*Streptococcus pneumoniae* is an opportunistic pathogen which is a causative agent for pneumonia, among other diseases, and a serious public health concern. The emergence of antibiotic-resistance has exacerbated this problem, with the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistance Bacteria recognizing *S. pneumoniae* as a “serious drug-resistance threat”. My work in the lab revolves around addressing these issues of public health concern. Specifically, it focuses on molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in the context of cell function and associated fitness costs. 

Previously, I have obtained M.Sc. in Biotechnology from University of Edinburgh (UK) and B.Tech. in Biotechnology from Amity University Uttar Pradesh (India). I completed my Master’s Thesis Project under the supervision of Prof. Charles Cockell, in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh & UK Centre for Astrobiology. My formative years were spent in The Lawrence School, Sanawar (India), situated in the foothills of Himalayas.
